<h3>Entry-ticket symptom</h3>
<h5>(South African Medical Journal 2009;99(7):508.)</h5>

<p>Recently a student commented that she had seen two patients 
in our clinic who presented with symptoms, ‘but they were 
not the real reason for them coming to see the doctor’. They 
had used the symptoms as what has been called ‘entry tickets’ 
into the consultation.  Although common in practice, these 
camouflaged messages are often not consciously registered by 
the doctor.  Similar ‘door-handle symptoms’ (1)
 may arise at the 
end of a consultation when the real reason for the encounter 
may eventually be raised.</p>

<p>Patients (and all of us) clothe many encounters in veils 
and metaphors, used as carriers of Morse code-like messages 
which we hope the receiver can decipher. Thus entry tickets 
can come encoded under the cover of an allusion or a slew of 
euphemisms, especially when discussing the great social taboos 
of urinary and bowel function, sex and death.  </p>

<p>Visiting the doctor is often unsettling and most of us rehearse 
what we are going to say on the way to the doctor’s office. 
Our words and sentences may be formulated into conditions 
that are socially acceptable in the context of a patient seeing a 
doctor. No one wants to be seen in a bad light, and our fears, 
guilt feelings and personal beliefs somehow become more 
acceptable as fatigue (2)
 and dizziness and that ‘strange’ pain. </p>

<p>We seldom come straight out with our troubling problem, 
but break the ice with the small talk about the traffic and the 
weather.  This phatic communion (from the Greek ‘spoken’) 
refers to non-medical preamble that helps us establish rapport. 
The main complaint may then follow, but even so ‘I am 
depressed’ is not usually presented as the first complaint. We 
often offer physical complaints in preference to mental health 
issues owing to embarrassment or shyness.</p>

<p> This communication involves the complex transition 
between how people experience their illnesses and how they 
talk about them.  For instance, a commonly encoded entry 
statement is ‘I want a check-up’, which later reveals a worry 
initiated by the recent illness or death of someone known to the 
patient, which has prompted the visit to the doctor.</p>

<p>Idioms and hidden agendas vary with age, sex, culture and 
context, but some form of pain (e.g. abdominal, backache or 
headache) is universally accepted, as are many expressions 
for fatigue and loss of energy. The headache may be real, but 
its relative weight and significance fades on revelation of the 
underlying alcohol abuse. In fact almost any physical or mental 
symptom can be used as the messenger for the infinite varieties 
of human distress. Balint (3)
 called them offers or a proposition of 
a symptom or illness that the patient makes to the doctor, who 
may accept it or make a counter-offer that may be followed by 
a negotiation.  Much of this may be to do with ‘face’, such as 
the noble symptom-bearer ‘putting on of a brave face’ (4)
 or the 
‘saving face’ when the patient uses another subject to divert the 
doctor’s attention away from an uncomfortable circumstance.</p>

<p>Entry-ticket symptoms may be intentional or unintentional 
due to anxiety or uncertainty about how to express oneself.  
Traditional people use many metaphors and entry-ticket 
symptoms both out of respect for the doctor and in their 
normal forms of address. Many cultures do not come to 
the point straight away but have circumlocutions before 
addressing the main subject. For instance, amaZulu men 
present with ‘kidneys’ (izinso) when worried about erectile 
dysfunction or if feeling contaminated after crossing a taboo 
such as finding out that they have slept with a menstruating 
woman. AmaZulu women may present with ‘stomach’ (isisu) 
as an initial symptom when they come in with infertility 
problems or to find out if they are pregnant. The amaZulu 
use a surrogate language when addressing people whom they 
respect (called hlonipha) and substitute words and names that 
are more appropriate for the situation. (5)
 Abdominal pain may 
be one of the commonest expressions of a hidden agenda in 
all cultures and can represent anything from fear of sexually 
transmitted disease to homesickness to the more common 
request for a sick certificate.</p>

<p>In a way, during a consultation both the doctor and the 
patient are fishing from opposite banks of a river. Entry-ticket 
symptoms at the beginning of medical consultations and 
door-handle symptoms at the end, and the whole mosaic of 
presentations in between, offer cues for the doctor to pick up. 
It is salutary to think that we may never know about those that 
we miss. </p>
