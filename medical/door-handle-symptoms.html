<h3>Door-handle symptom</h3>
<h5>(South African Medical Journal. 2004;94(12):951-2)</h5>


<p>In family medicine teaching there are specific steps one should
take for the closure of a consultation, such as summarising,
follow-up arrangements and various reinforcement and
reflective processes.  Well, that is the theory, anyway.  It is
sometimes called ‘methods of breaking rapport’.  Yet somehow
quite a few of my consultations don’t seem to pan out in this
way.</p>

<p>Take for instance, my Mrs McNaughton*.  Trying to finish a
consultation with her is an art form in itself.  After the main
business of the consultation has been completed and the blood
pressure has been taken, the abdomen palpated and the
prescription written, I rise with her folder in my hand.  It is my
first grand hint.  As I head for the door she says ‘but Doctor
Chris that is not why I came in to see you ...’.  It is like the false
start for the 100 m when the chap fires the starting pistol twice
and you have to return to the starting line.   We then proceed
back to the examination couch and examine the new complaint
and return back to our original positions in our respective
chairs.  Having readjusted her prescription I resume my
position under starter’s orders, manage a fairly swift take-off
and get to the consulting door while simultaneously engaging
in ‘closure’ conversation to the effect that the consultation is
now over.  </p>

<p>She, on the other hand, is still firmly embedded in her chair
and is craning her neck around to see where I have gone, quite
oblivious to my behaving like a cat on a hot tin roof.  I have
now opened the door and am waving it gently in a beckoning
rhythm which seems eventually to have the required effect.  As
she passes between me and the door she suddenly stops, and
putting her hand into her bag, says ‘oh, I nearly forgot, could
you fill in these chronic medications forms for me ...?’.  I find
myself at this point gripping the door handle in a firmer way
than is perhaps necessary and experiencing a form of air
hunger where I hyperventilate with increasing inspiratory
stridor.</p>

<p>I give this as an example of symptoms or requests, in this
case of both the patient and the doctor, that can happen at the
very end of a consultation.</p>

<p>Patients may never reveal their real motive for coming to the
doctor for several reasons such as shyness, perceiving that the
doctor is too rushed, or because the doctor is on a different
wave-length. This may lead, at the end, to patients mentioning
their most pressing problem almost as an aside, as their hand is
on the door handle.</p>

<p>My first experience of a significant door-handle symptom
was when I had just qualified and was in practice in a small
village on the west coast of Canada.  I was looking after a
Mennonite colony living up in the hills.  The Mennonites are a
fundamentalist religious sect rather like the Amish, who were
made famous in Harrison Ford’s film, Witness.</p>

<p>I was looking after a young married Mennonite woman and
attended the delivery of her baby at our local hospital.  In the
following year she consulted me frequently for various
complaints and one day I informed her, after we had
completed the consultation, that I was leaving the village to go
to Africa.  She thanked me for looking after her; as she got to
the door and with her hand on the door-handle, facing the
door, she said ‘I don’t get orgasms’.  I don’t believe she would
ever have mentioned it if I had not been leaving the practice. 
(I can’t remember how I responded, as I was trained at medical
school in the sixties when ‘not getting orgasms’ was not
included in the curriculum.   It was then the beginning of a
wider sexual awakening in North America and Europe  and
orgasms were becoming compulsory.  Of course now it is the
first question I ask after ‘are you on medical aid?’.)</p>

<p>Apart from sexual problems patients often leave unspoken
many fears of dreaded diseases.  A colleague of mine had a
patient who consulted him for low lumbar back pain. He
examined him thoroughly and explained with the aid of a
diagram that the cause of his backache was a disc
degeneration.  He prescribed anti-inflammatories and asked
the patient to contact him if the pain did not go away. The
patient reached the door after the consultation and with his
hand on the door-handle turned to my colleague and said ‘so
from what you have told me then I don’t have cancer’.
Conditions that may seem perfectly straightforward to the
doctor may have a completely different significance for the
patient.</p>

<p>Recently a man presented to me with symptoms of a kidney
or urinary infection.  He even suggested that he thought his
problem was an infection in his kidneys.  I tested the urine,
which was clear, and reassured him that the symptoms might
be caused by muscle spasm. I was aware that there might be
another agenda, but it was at the end of the day and my
superbly tuned incisive diagnostic skills were not at their
sharpest. We ended on that note and as he got to the door he
said, as an aside, ‘I believe there is a pill for it nowadays’.  I
knew intuitively exactly what he was talking about. He was
referring to Viagra and we went on to raise the subject, so to
speak.</p>

<p>My most recent door-handle symptom involved a man with
sores on his arms and legs.  I explained that they were Natal or
veld sores and were caused by bacteria.  I prescribed antibiotics
to take by mouth and a nasal cream, which I explained was to
kill the reservoir of organisms in his nose.  As he went out of
the door he hesitated and said ‘do you think I should have an
AIDS test?’. I asked why he thought this was necessary. He
replied that a worker in his factory had just died of AIDS and
his symptoms had started with skin sores.  I had treated his
condition, but I had completely missed his reason for coming
to see me.</p>
