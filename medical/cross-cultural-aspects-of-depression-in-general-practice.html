<h3>Cross-cultural aspects of depression in general practice</h3>
<h5>(South African Medical Journal 2003; 93(5):342-5)</h5>

<p>It was previously thought that black Africans from traditional
cultures rarely suffered from what in the West is classified as
depression. The word ‘fatalistic’ was often used to describe
what was assumed to be a lack of emotion or feeling. It is being
increasingly discovered by psycholinguistic and psychological
research that depression in black Africans is underdiagnosed as
it presents in different ways of living and interacting as well as
from a different existential dimension and world view.</p>

<p>From a constellation of symptoms and signs, the West has
developed a concept and label of depression that fits and suits
Western culture. Traditional African culture has not concretised
or labelled this concept yet so that it remains diffuse and
undifferentiated. It may present with different linguistic
phrases, metaphors of life and symbolic language and often as
a story that attempts to express the complex realities of life.</p>

<p>An exploration into these stories (and other mediums such
as song, theatre, poetry and literature) may reveal that
depression is as common among black Africans as it is in the
West, but that it is unrecognised and underdiagnosed.</p>

<p>How does one diagnose depression in a Zulu patient who
comes down from the villages of Hlatikhulu or Ntabamhlophe
in the mountains, or from Msinga and Nkandla in the low
bushveld? It is a meeting between two worlds of different
experience, meaning, language and culture.
The patient works within the experience of his or her social
and cultural life whereas the doctor works within the criteria
laid down by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV)
(1) and has a list of symptoms that have to be fulfilled before the
diagnosis can be made. These symptoms and references are
derived from both a biomedical perspective and the doctor’s
own experience of living in the Western world. The doctor’s
language and even grammar are technologically based. We
have now classified almost every activity that human beings
are capable of and are busy with subsets and smaller boxes,
into which human behaviour can be fitted. When we encounter
a traditional African culture that is not informed in this way
and that experiences illness differently, we are often at a loss as
how to assess, diagnose and treat such patients.</p>
 
<p>For instance, traditional rural Africans may not differentiate
their cognitive functions from their bodily functions and
symptoms. Their dreams, visions, feelings and inner thoughts
are not separated from their bodily symptoms of illness. There
is no dichotomy between the spirit or soul and the body.(2)</p>

<p>Western psychiatry over the last two centuries of scientific
discussion, logical argument, pattern recognition and empirical
observation has grouped certain constellations of symptoms
and experiences into diagnoses or labels such as depression.
Traditional people on the other hand may not experience these
conditions in such a delineated and categorised way. Their
experiences are more open and connected to the world around
them. They are connected to the world via relationships with
their families and significant others as well as with the
environment, nature and with relatives who have recently
died. </p>

<p>How, as a doctor, do you convey the concept of depression to
such a people, and how, conversely, do they express their
symptoms when they may not have the concept or the
language available in their culture? The cultural journey
appears to start from a constellation of experiences that are
recognised as forming some type of cohesive entity, which is
then labelled and can then be communicated.(3)</p>

<p>This is not necessarily a cross-cultural problem as this form
of communication and its difficulties are common to the
human race and all cultures; however, it is highlighted and
emphasised when two very disparate cultures meet.(4)</p>

<h3>Level of direct translation</h3>

<p>Partly because of time constraints, most of us function in our
practices at the level of literal or direct translation. The words
used by patients are taken to represent the ‘real’ world (called
the realist view). (5) I am going to use English-Zulu cross-cultural
interactions as my examples as I am an English immigrant
doctor working with Zulus. In Zulu there are, in fact, words
that might approximate to the idea of depression. Dangala
means to be dejected or worn out of body and mind. Khathele/
ukukhathala in Zulu is used more to convey fatigue but also
often carries a sense of worry, while ukukhathazeka in Zulu and
Xhosa conveys upset, hurt, heartsore, sadness, grief or worry.
The plurality of translation of these words emphasises the
importance of context in connection with the way many mental
conditions are experienced and expressed. In this way illness
cannot be separated from context or the socially and
linguistically mediated nature of human illness (called the
material-discursive approach). (6) Likewise, depression often
cannot be isolated from other co-morbid conditions such as
anxiety or alcohol and substance abuse.</p>

<p>The Western world also tends to view or objectify conditions
as being more static than in the traditional world view, which
appears to experience the world more in a state of natural
evolution and change. For instance, expressing one’s feelings as
ukulangazelelela ukwenza into ethize means literally ‘to crave to
do some things’ and expresses an inability to settle down, of
not being able to relax until you have done something that is
worrying you, or a feeling of incompletion. Ingcindezi describes
a condition when the patient cannot think or concentrate
properly when required to do so. This person is more likely to
have sleepless nights and his/her mind is preoccupied.(8)</p>

<p>I have given the above as examples of the typical way that a
Western mind like mine searches for equivalent concepts. There
is a literal translation followed by a neat package or label.
Unfortunately the maps of one culture may not fit the territory
of another and one often does not progress past the Western
diagnosis or label. The Cultural Hermeneutic Model of medical
practice (9) describes a meaning-centred approach in which one
goes beyond the medical diagnosis to interpret the meaning,
experience and explanations of the causes of the diseases as
held by the patients.</p>

<h3>Traditional African presentation of depression</h3>

<p>The presentation of depression may be divided, in a necessarily
artificial way, into four main forms. This is from the
perspective of a general practitioner and pertains to the
primary care profile encountered by a generalist and not the
profile of patients referred to a psychiatrist.</p>

<h4>Somatic complaints</h4>

<p>Firstly, depression often presents as some form of bodily
complaint. The patient expresses an embodied experience of
human illness, (10) speaking with his or her body. Pain may be
expressed as headache/ikhanda, backache/iqolo, stomach
ache/isisu, chest pain/isifuba or whole-body pain/wonke
umzimba. These are messages from the patient, or what Michael
Balint called ‘offers’ (11) or others have called ‘patient requests’. (12)
They are acceptable carriers of existential pain in the society of
both the sufferer and the Western doctor. In family medicine
they have been called Entry Ticket symptoms (13) if they are used
at the beginning of a consultation, and Door Handle symptoms
if they are used at the end of a consultation, when the patient is
about to open the door and leave.</p>

<p>Wittgenstein concluded that statements about pain were not
necessarily intended as descriptions of internal sensations but
were social messages that needed attention at a different level
than the biological. (14)</p>

<h4>Fatigue variants</h4>

<p>After some form of pain, and probably of equal frequency and
importance, is the symptom of some form of
fatigue/ukukhathala, loss of energy/ukuphela amandla or
tiredness/ukukhandleka, which can also mean suffering from an
illness for a long time.</p>

<h4>Messages of distress</h4>

<p>Thirdly is a miscellaneous group of symptoms that are almost
infinite and often individual such as dizziness/isiyezi, loss of
appetite/inhliziyo imnyama, and sleeplessness/ukuqwasha. This
is no different from Western patients and is often interwoven
with anxiety as a co-morbid condition. Two general symptoms,
which may be sensitive markers of anxiety-depressive states,
are irritability/ucasuka kalula, or to be irritated by a slight
noise/casulwa umsindo omncane, and disturbed sleeping
patterns/abufika ubuthongo. A useful open question in these
cases is ‘when you are unable to sleep, what do you think
about?’.</p>

<p>Some generalised complaints in all cultures come like subtle
waves across the consulting room desk, such as ‘I’m not feeling
myself’ or ‘I’m just not feeling well’. Similarly in Zulu
angiwuzwa umzimba literally means ‘I cannot feel (zwa) my
body’. It can be a metaphor indicating that one is out of touch
with one’s body and perhaps the real world as well. The
patient conveys the uncertainty of not knowing what s/he is
suffering from, which may add to or exacerbate the condition.
This may also take the form of other general statements such as
‘I am suffering badly’/ngiphatheke kabi or more specific
statements such as ‘I am thinking a lot’/ngicabanga kakhulu.</p>

<h4>Problematic relationships</h4>

<p>The fourth presentation of depression in this artificial
overview, involves descriptions or stories given by the patient
of problems with relationships at home and at work and with
life events that have happened to them. The presentations may
be expressions of distress that may represent socio-cultural
conflict, which cannot be addressed within the biomedical
framework of diagnosis and treatment. (10,15)
They are often told in the form of a story or narrative (called narrative-based
medicine). (16) Carl Jung felt that diagnosis helped the doctor but
for the patient the crucial thing was the story. (17) 
Stories particularise patients’ experience of illness within their local
and personal worlds. The experience of the suffering is
fashioned in the telling of it. I often find the word ‘since’ leads
into a story of a turning point in a patient’s life such as ‘since
my husband died. . .’, ‘since the accident. . .’. Another word cue
can be ‘battle’ or ‘battling’ in which the story is told as a fight,
with depression or illness as the enemy. Many doctors are
unable to listen to these stories because of time constraints and
are more focused on the search for diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>All cultures, in fact, can present depression in a variety of the
above categories but the presentation in more traditional
societies is more likely to be delivered metaphorically or
symbolically as idioms of distress, linguistic images, metaphors
or associative phrases. The challenge is the interpretive process
(called hermeneutics) (18)
to gain an understanding of the world
of the patient and how the individual is experiencing his or her
illnesses.</p>

<h3>Symbolic language</h3>

<p>Traditional Africans usually worry from the heart rather than
from the mind, and Zulus have some beautiful metaphors such
as inhliziyo ishona phansi, which means the heart dies or sinks
down, and inhliziyo iyakhathala, the heart is tired. When they
speak symbolically they may refer to blood, igazi, as in igazi
seliphelile, the blood is finished. In the same way the word
umoya may be used to express either breath, as in shortness of
breath, or as a symbol or metaphor for one’s spirit or soul. (2)</p>

<h4>Barriers to communication</h4>

<p>Many invisible barriers exist between what I have been
referring to as the traditional African patient and the Western
doctor. These are, among others, status, education, and poverty.
Gender is also a factor. Women often do not have the words, or
do not have access to the words when speaking to a male or in
male company. It is the silence of powerlessness. There is also
the tradition of ukuhlonipha, which broadly means respect and
involves deliberately using alternative words as a gesture of
respect. This custom often requires that the woman does not
make direct eye contact with someone of supposedly superior
status, and the downward look of the eyes may be erroneously
interpreted by the doctor as a non-verbal message of
depression.</p>

<p>This is just one contextual text illustrating that language is only
one of the ways in which depression is expressed. There are
also vocal cues that can be, almost subconsciously, picked up
along with the verbal content, such as rate of speech,
downward inflection of the voice and hesitations in the speech.
Intuitively one may pick up that body movements, including
eye movements, have slowed down, which Kafka described as
a ‘shy, evasive, glassy-eyed manner of speech’. (19)
There is also non-verbal communication, e.g. facial expressions, body
posture and hand gestures. ‘The gestures of the hands’, said
Wittgenstein, ‘are organs of language’. (20)
Some studies appear to
indicate that guilt seems to be a less common feature of
depression in Africa and is experienced in a different way. (10)
It is
an extremely difficult mood or thought process to define but it
is often interwoven with depression in the Western world.</p>

<h3>Dual consultations</h3>

<p>Another interesting feature of African mental disorders in
general is dual or multiple consultations with other agencies
such as family members (usually the senior grandmother), and,
among others, traditional healers and faith healers, who are
consulted before the medical doctor. The pathways that
patients pick and choose in their health-seeking behaviour are
called patterns of resort. (21) Traditional healers are either cast by
the West in the role of charlatans, or conversely are overromanticised as being more in touch with nature and the
feelings of their clients. Many traditional healers have a
calling/ukuthwasa and help in the caring and healing process of
the whole person, addressing the condition and also restoring
balance by addressing the alleged causes of the illness. (22) Others
are charlatans who produce diagnoses like magicians pulling
rabbits out of a hat and may confirm and thereby exacerbate
bewitchment without providing support. (10) Herbal medicines
may also cause damage in the form of hepatic and renal
toxicity. The medical profession is not blameless in this regard
either, but has the benefit of legislated governing bodies and
accountability to elected councils.</p>

<h3>Search for causation</h3>
<p>Another dimension in the diagnosis of depression is that it is
not recognised by the patient as an illness or disease per se, but
as a disturbance caused by breaking a taboo or displeasing an
ancestor, or due to a spell that has been cast on the patient.
This is not a specifically traditional African trait as all patients
in all cultures seek to know the reason why they are ill. (23)
Western patients rely mainly on answers from technological
medicine whereas more traditional cultures seek divination
from a healer, who can restore the equilibrium of their lives. In
this context traditional Africa has many explanatory models for
mental illness called ukufa kwabantu, which broadly means ‘the
illnesses of the people’. (24)
The DSM-IV uses the term Culture
Bound Syndrome for these conditions, which ‘denotes
recurrent, locality-specific patterns of aberrant behaviour and
troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a
particular DSM-IV diagnostic category’. (25)</p>

<p>Asking the patient what he thinks is the cause of his condition
may reveal one of these categories. Among Zulus illness may be
blamed on spirit possession/i n d i k i/u f u f u n y a n e/i z i z w e, pollution
or contamination/u m n y a m a, bewitchment/sorc e r y /u b u t h a k a t h i,
curses or spells/ukuphosa or some form of poisoning/
umkhondo/umeqo/idliso. (2,24,26) These labels just touch the surface
of a complex cultural heritage that explains the world in
d i ff e rent dimensions and from a more mystical, spiritual and
cultural view than that of modern medical technology.
Nevertheless mental disorders do not necessarily have 
to have a deeper explanation attached to them, for instance,
m a d n e s s /u k u h l a n y a may be thought of as coming from
bewitchment but is often understood as just happening or
somehow coming from the sky.</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I have tried in this paper to remain as practical as possible. It is
not possible to enter here into the great debates of whether
depression is a mood, a symptom or a psychiatric disease. The
feeling of being sad or depressed is very common in the
general population. Depression has been addressed as a
distinct identity, whereas it is usually interwoven with anxiety
which appears to present in the traditional African in a more
diffuse fashion with fear/esaba, apprehensiveness/ixhala or
‘butterflies in the stomach’ metaphors/ ukushaywa uvalo,
which convey fear in the pit of the stomach.</p>

<p>There is also debate as to whether depression is
biologically and medically constructed, or socially and
culturally constructed. One’s culture tells one how to view
the world, how to experience it emotionally and how to
behave in the world in relationship to other people. (10)</p>

<p>There is so much overlap between diagnostic labels in the
field of psychiatry that an interesting model was developed
by the World Health Organisation focusing on the six
commonest conditions, namely depression, anxiety
disorders, alcohol use disorders, sleep problems,
unexplained somatic complaints and chronic tiredness. This
model has been extended for use in South Africa at the
undifferentiated level of ‘mental problem’ (7)
for use in primary health care. </p>

<p>The example of language/culture in this overview has
been English-Zulu, yet it appears from research of the
literature that the thematic representations are similar in
most other southern African cultures, although the
metaphors and symbolism may differ. Patients in all
cultures speak metaphorically in most consultations and
metaphors may even be different in the same language
group but in different areas. For instance, ikhanda liyabanda,
which literally means ‘the head is cold’, is only used as a
representation of headache in parts of northern Zululand.</p>

<p>The West has become so powerful and English so
ubiquitous that eventually it will probably be best for the
concept and condition of depression to be expressed by the
word ‘depression’ in African languages and cultures. This
insertion of an English word, which has no equivalent in an
African language, is called ‘code mixing’ (27)
and seems
inevitable. Many educated black Africans in my practice
already present with the words, ‘I feel depressed’.
Nevertheless diagnosis and treatment of conditions such
as depression will be made easier as we spend more effort 
learning about the population we work with. This applies
especially to patients’ attitudes to disease, their health
practices and beliefs, and knowing about the therapists,
who are important in their lives. One of the major steps is
accepting the above as valid for the patient sitting in front of
you.</p>

<p>Together with this acceptance goes an understanding of
the many forms in which depression and other mental
disorders are presented, especially in the traditional rural
areas of Africa.</p>
