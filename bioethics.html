<h3>Deferential vulnerability and patient decision-making</h3>
<h5>(S Afr J Bioethics Law 2017;10(2):56-57. DOI:10.7196/SAJBL.2017.v10i2.609)</h5>

<p>
    Deferential vulnerability arises when individuals subordinate
    themselves or submit to an authority figure when making decisions
    about their day-to-day lives and existence within their specific
    environment and relationships. This customary obedience occurs in
    cultures where certain hierarchical systems exist within the family or
    community. Vulnerable individuals may include, but are not limited
    to, women, children, the elderly and sometimes young adults.</p><p>
    Deferential vulnerability may occur within a medical relationship
    when patients defer to the authority of other family members or
    agencies when making health-related decisions. These decisions may
    not necessarily be involuntary or even be given unwillingly (that is,
    they may not necessarily be under direct duress or coercion), but the
    patient either makes decisions based on advice or directives from
    authority figures, or defers the decision in its entirety to such figures
    recognised by his or her cultural, community or religious contexts
    and customs. This can result in grey areas between acquiescence and
    voluntariness in the consent process. They often place the medical
    practitioner in a difficult situation as, on the one hand, the law
    requires consent from an individual patient or their legal proxy, and
    on the other hand, obtaining consent in an ethically sound manner
    requires consent to be a process in which effective decision-making
    is facilitated.</p><p>
    There is one further step that many African and indigenous
    communities worldwide may take in deferment, and that is to consult
    the ancestors or forefathers. Every now and then, the relatives of a
    patient may ask to take the patient home so that sacrifices (usually
    a goat or a cow) may be made to the ancestors, and also defer to a
    traditional healer to seek guidance in their consent deliberations.</p><p>
    Another form of deferential vulnerability may occur in more
    conservative traditional families. Female patients from these families
    are usually accompanied by a male member of the family, such as the
    husband, brother or father. Decisions are often made by the family
    as a community, as opposed to a Western individualistic decision
    that is left to the patient alone. In these particular circumstances,
    women may be vulnerable, but alternatively, may also be protected,
    depending on the specific dynamics within the family.</p><p>
    A recent case involved a 2-year-old Zulu child who needed a shunt
    owing to increasing intracranial pressure from a hydrocephalus. The
    mother was willing to give consent for the operation, but the father
    was unwilling, and the mother’s mother (the child’s grandmother)
    also objected to the operation. In South African law, only one parent
    needs to give consent for a child’s operation. If there is a dispute, the
    key criterion is, what is in the best interests of the child? Zulu society
    is still, to some extent, patriarchal in nature, and the grandmother of
    a family also holds considerable authority concerning decisions over
    health matters. In this particular case, the mother, although willing,
    would not sign the consent forms out of deference to the authority
    of the father of her child and also the grandmother. This scenario
    demonstrates the potential impact of deferential vulnerability, as
    here the child was denied an important procedure because of
    concerns expressed by authority figures.</p><p>
    The influence of the family or community on individual choices is a
    subtle aspect of decision-making. This may not be as straightforward
    as it seems, because if I live in a society in which my partner makes
    all the decisions, and I am in agreement with this arrangement, then
    according to some ethicists, it is considered autonomous behaviour
    to let my partner make decisions on my behalf. We know that there
    are many subconscious influences at play when one consents to a
    procedure or operation, yet when people in groups are asked to make
    decisions they may come to very different conclusions than when
    asked to make such decisions individually. Although we all value
    information concerning our illnesses, we may not be as enthusiastic
    about making decisions for ourselves as theorists assume. In some
    situations we may prefer to let someone else decide for us. This
    is similar to the Sartrian view that man is condemned to be free,
    but does not necessarily enjoy the responsibility or burden of this
    freedom.</p><p>
    In obtaining informed consent one of the first steps is to check that
    the technological information has been relayed and understood by
    the patients and those assisting them. Even understanding the basic
    concepts and the words used to describe them is often difficult. The
    impasse with the child with rising intracranial pressure was solved by
    involving a traditional healer, along with the hospital counsellor, to
    explain the situation to the father and grandmother in a way and in a
    language that they could fully understand. In this way, cumbersome
    as it may seem, the authority figures in the child’s and mother’s life
    were brought into the decision-making process, thereby ensuring
    that the child’s best interests were served.</p><p>
    We all surrender part of our decision-making rights in systems with
    which we are unfamiliar, or to persons with the relevant knowledge
    or power, be they lawyers, accountants or electricians. In addition,
however well-informed we are, we often have problems subjectively
balancing the risks and benefits of any action, especially when it
comes to medical treatment.</p><p>
While the ideal would be fully autonomous, uncoerced decisions,
no one is fully autonomous – neither doctors nor patients. Despite
these several restrictions and influences, we aspire to obtain the best
quality of consent and decision-making for our patients. The question
arises as to whether one uses Western ethical and communication
models, or creates new models which are co-constituted by
agreements between Western technological cultures and indigenous
or traditional cultures. The best way forward may be to gradually
introduce integrative models by increasing our communication
skills and patient education, and also beyond the patient, to those
in authority in their lives. This is not entirely possible without
simultaneous social and educational change in the index populations.
