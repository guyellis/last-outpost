    In these pages you will read about horse psychology, the KwaZulu/Natal braaivleis,
    how to talk to your compost heap and about a rugger match between the Michaelhouse
    sixth team and Maritzburg college eighth team. It had, for some reason, never been
    reported before in the annals of South African rugby until it was published in the
    Witness, in which many of these stories were previously published.
