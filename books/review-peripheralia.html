<h3>
    Peripheralia: Digressions From Medical Practice<br />
    (by Chris Ellis)
</h3>
<p>
    Chris Ellis’s new book is called Peripheralia: Digressions from
Medical Practice. It is a collection of fifty of his already
published columns from South African Family Practice and the
South African Medical Journal. The word “Peripheralia” was
coined by the author to describe the conditions and
experiences that occur around the periphery of medicine.</p><p>
The author is a general practitioner in Pietermaritzburg but
has also worked as a medical journalist for over thirty
years and writes the Unconstant Gardener column
for Diversions. He is an honorary lecturer at the
University of KwaZulu-Natal and was
previously associate professor offamily
medicine at the University of the United
Arab Emirates.</p><p>
This is his second collection of published
columns which follow the anthology, The
Soft Edges of Family Practice. The author
has a keen eye for observing his
patients, his partners and the
communities of both his practice and
the local hospitals where he works.
This body of work is almost impossible
to categorize as he writes about the
way doctors dress and then on to
neurolinguistic programming and to

conversational trances and door-
handle symptoms. These are

qualitative essays on doctors and
patients as normal human beings
interacting with each other.</p><p>
The author describes other peripheral
strategies such as the sensory garden
that he built for the patients of a

psychiatric hospital where he had part-
time sessions. There are the therapies

of watering, pottering, smelling the
roses and leaning on rakes.</p><p>
A recurring theme is that of the way

doctors interpret both verbal and non-
verbal signals. One does not often

come across medical articles with titles
such as “Semiotics in the Medical
Consultation” and “The Words are the
Illness”. Another bee that the author
admits to buzzing in his bonnet is
practice management. There are
columns on the design of consulting
rooms, patient flow, the prepared
patient and integrated systems that
make the most time-efficient way of
seeing patients.</p><p>
So if you want to read about smell as
a diagnostic tool, the rules of arguing
and isomorphic narratives then this
book may introduce you to some of
the peripheralia around the practice
of medicine.
