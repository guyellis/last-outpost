<h3>
    Out of Chaos Comes a Dancing Star – Notes on Professional Burnout<br />
    (Review by Professor Dan Ncayiyana)
</h3>
<p>
        Chris Ellis. Pp 95. Oasis Open
        Books. 2014. ISBN 978-0-620-
        55803-7</p><p>
        Chris Ellis, the author of
        this little book, was a
        family practitioner in
        the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands
        for many years before going
        into “semi-retirement”. The
        older readers of the South
        African Medical Journal will
        recall Dr Ellis’ occasional
        essays, published in the
        journal in years gone
        by, in which he shared
        anecdotes from his medical
        practice, for their wit and humour. This little book,
        based on his notes as facilitator at workshops and courses on burnout,
        mirrors the same style.</p><p>
        Although this booklet is billed as “Notes on Professional Burnout”, the content is in
        fact much broader, touching on a wide variety of situations that may stand in the way
        of a fulfilling medical career and can serve to undermine the psychological wellbeing
        and professional performance of practitioners. The hurdles include loneliness, stress,
        depression, family and spousal relationships, money issues and so forth. The book further
        references situations where the doctor may be his or her own worst enemy. These are
        explored in chapters on the doctor as a patient, the “wounded healer”, the “Mr God
        Complex”, the angry doctor, the impaired physician and other traits. Other chapters
        contain quotable passages (or poems) from classical literature, such as the Prayer of St
        Francis of Assisi.</p><p>
        Burnout may result from long hours and no sleep, poor working conditions, an uncaring
        hospital administration, “neglect, inefficiency, departmental politics and staff who do
        not share the same goals”, overwork and demanding patients. One suggested means of
        escaping burnout is titled “Downshifting, choosing quality of life and voluntary simplicity”,
        which may involve “accepting a lower level of income and lower level of consumption,
        resulting in more time with the family and restraint in the use of luxuries”.</p><p>
        This booklet is not a vade mecum on burnout or any of the other personal challenges
        that may confront doctors in medical practice. It does not pretend to provide answers
        and solutions. Written in short, one- or two-page chapters, it will serve splendidly as a
        bedside manual for daily reflection and meditation.
